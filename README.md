# Github Trends

This script will help you find 20 most usable repositories created for last week.

# Quick start

```bash
$ python3 github_trending.py
```

Running on Windows is similar.

*(Possibly requires call of 'python' executive instead of just 'python3'.)*

# Example

```bash
$ python3 github_trending.py
